## Conclusion

I had alot of fun with this project, it was a great exercise to solidify understanding how react.js fundementally works. Though I feel like I can spend alot more time on this portfolio, there are so many things I would like to add (animations, maybe a different color pallete, and definitely a better headshot), I feel that this assignment definitely got the ball rolling for me in terms of understanding how the structure of react "flows". I think what will make my project stand out is the general aesthetic of my portfolio!
